## TLDR
It became apparent that the keylogger is being activated by the Activator.CreateInstance() method which is calling to run an executable or dll file. The activator is getting the information from the Person.CurrentSlides() function which then goes deep into the other method calls and eventually decrypts the dll file stores in the agam.Properties.Resrouces.resources file. This is where the keylogger is called and runs. It turns out the keylogger isnâ€™t just a keylogger, but in fact a RAT as well. The rat runs a web service locally and creates a backdoor. Overall, this was a great learning experience and found a lot of interesting things that we did not expect.
